A CommonJS Runtime for [GJS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs/wikis/Home)

### Features

Differently from [jsgtk](https://github.com/WebReflection/jsgtk), this project has the following goals and features:

  * 100% based on GJS. No wrapping, no runtime transpilation, pure ECMAScript 2015+ via SpiderMonkey 52+
  * Gtk _camelCase_ methods are provided only on demand and if needed. You are free to `require('Gtk')`, which will add _camelCase_ method, or just regular GJS `imports.gi.Gtk`, suggested to develop core modules too.
  * by default, the core brings in only most basic features to develop CommonJS modules for GJS:
    * a `global` reference to the shared global GJS object
    * globally available timers such `setImmediate(fn, ...args)`, `setInterval(fn, delay, ...args)`, `setTimeout(fn, delay, ...args)` with also their `clearImmediate/Interval/Timeout(id)` counter functions
    * a spec compliant `require` function with `require.cache` and a `require.resolve` implemented via the [proper algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together)
  * all other core modules will be made available as soon as available
  * each core module is developed a part:
    * easier to maintain
    * easier to update
    * easier to track changes
    * easier to also contribute ðŸŽ‰

### Core Installation

You need both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [gjs](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gjs) available on your system.

Once you have both, you can install `cgjs` either locally, and use it via `npx cgjs`, or globally.

```sh
# global install example
npm install -g cgjs

# see default options
cgjs --help
```

### CommonJS Modules

### Basic GJS info

You can install globally the [cgjs-about](https://github.com/cgjs/cgjs-about) utility and query it as described in the repository.

Together with `grep` it's a great way to have a quick overview of every namespace.
